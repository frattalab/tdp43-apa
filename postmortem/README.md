`python scripts/add_decoys_to_gtf.py -i data/PAPA/2023-06-20_cryptic_last_exons.gtf -r data/reference_filtered.gtf -d full -o processed/2023-06-21_cryptics_plus_decoys.decoys_full`

add_decoys_to_gtf requirements:

- `event_type_simple` attribute, which is generated using `preproccesing/scripts/clean_papa_tbls.R`:

  - spliced - last exon with novel SJ
  - bleedthrough - last exon that extends an annotated internal exon (or annotated last exon that bleeds through )
  - distal_3utr_extension - 

- input last exons contain a 'ref_gene_id` attribute, which corresponds to the reference gene_id to which the last exon overlaps/belongs. This is satisfied if you use 'novel_ref_combined.last_exons.gtf' generated by PAPA pipeline.
